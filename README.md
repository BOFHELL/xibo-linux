Xibo for Linux is a Digital Signage Player for [Xibo](https://xibo.org.uk).

It is in its early stages of development and supports a subset of Xibo's overall features. It can be used in production, but should be thoroughly tested with the intended content. It is not recommended to assume that any of Xibo's features will function. Please test yourself to confirm.

To discuss this Player with us, please [join our community](https://community.xibo.org.uk/c/support/linux-player).



# Installation

Installation and upgrade instructions can be found [here](https://xibo.org.uk/docs/setup/xibo-for-linux-installation).



# Contributing

We use GitHub Issues to track development and the next milestone is full of issues for which we would happily accept contributions. In addition, if a Xibo feature you want is not mile-stoned, or mile-stoned against a later version, please get in touch if you'd like to work on it. We maintain a [Kanban Board](https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-linux/projects/1) to ensure we're not doing overlapping work.

Please check that you're happy for your work to be available under the project licence - the AGPLv3 or later.
